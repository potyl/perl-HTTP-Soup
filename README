HTTP::Soup
==========

This module provides the Perl bindings for the C library "libsoup", which in
turn provides a HTTP client/server library for GNOME.

Lisoup is an HTTP client/server library for GNOME. It uses GObjects and the glib
main loop, to integrate well with GNOME applications, and also has a synchronous
API, for use in threaded applications.

Libsoup is used in many GNOME projects and other software including gtk-webkit.

Features include:

	- Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
	- Automatically caches connections
	- SSL Support using GnuTLS
	- Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
	- Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
	- Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
	- Client and server support for XML-RPC
